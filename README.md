ABSTRACT 

   This project presents an accident prevention using eye blink sensor for preventing accident due to drowsy is prevented and controlled when the vehicle is out of control. And also the drunken drive also prevented by installing alcohol detector in the vehicle. The term used here for the recognisation that the driver is drowsy is by using Eye Blink Sensing system (EBS) of the driver. In recent times drowsiness is one of the major causes for highway accidents. The drowsiness is identified by the eye blink closure and blinking frequency through infra-red sensor worn by driver by means of spectacles frame. If the driver is drunk then the buzzer indicates and the vehicle doesnâ€™t allow the driver to start the vehicle. If the driver is drowsy, then the system will give buzzer signal and the speed of the vehicle is reduced. The final part of EBS system is applied by using a goggle
This device provides much advanced facilities in now a days life as it can be easily implemented in vehicles. This device provides safety for government transports. It is useful for tour & travel agency. It can also be used in schools, colleges, offices and some public places taking attention of drunken persons. Military application where high intensity monitoring of soldier is needed.
